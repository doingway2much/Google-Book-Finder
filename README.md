#  Google Book Finder

This is a full stack M.E.R.N application create in my Georgia Tech Coding bootcamp.  This app lets you serach for books and renders them to the page using React.  It does this by using the Google Books API and then pulls off the data for each book using Axios.  Once rendeder it puts the data in state which allos us to pass it to an API route to save the book to the DB.  Once the book is saved you can delete the book by sending the data from state to the API route.
